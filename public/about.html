<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With the help of Angela Yu's HTML course, I began my journey into web development and quickly gained confidence in building simple yet structured websites. Her clear and practical teaching style made it easy for me to understand the core concepts of HTML, such as elements, structure, headings, paragraphs, and lists. Step by step, I started applying what I learned by building real projects.</p>
<p>One of the first projects I created was a Movie Ranking website. This project helped me practice using ordered lists, headings, and basic formatting. It gave me a better understanding of how to organize content on a web page and how HTML can be used to present information in a clean and structured way.</p>
<p>The second project I completed was a Birthday Invitation page. Through this, I learned how to insert images, add links, and combine different elements to create a visually engaging page. Completing these two projects boosted my confidence and sparked my interest in learning more about web development.</p>
